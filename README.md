# Code-Generation-Application-Using-Qlora

## Project Overview
In This Project, Dataset was finetuned on Orca 3B model to create a code generation application 

The code was trained on 1000 rows out of possible 55,000 rows due to computation challanges but updated model will be released

Sample prompts are in the notebook. 

## Work To be done
Increase training data

Deploy the model

Test With other models
